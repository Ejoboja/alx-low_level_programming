Task 0: Print list
Write a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list and returns the number of nodes. You are allowed to use printf.

Task 1: List length
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.

Task 2: Add node
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list and returns the address of the new element, or NULL if it fails.

Task 3: Add node at the end
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list and returns the address of the new element, or NULL if it fails.

Task 4: Free list
Write a function that frees a listint_t list.

Task 5: Free
Write a function that frees a listint_t list and sets the head to NULL.

Task 6: Pop
Write a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list and returns the head node's data. If the linked list is empty, it returns 0.

Task 7: Get node at index
Write a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list. If the node does not exist, it returns NULL.

Task 8: Sum list
Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list. If the list is empty, it returns 0.

Task 9: Insert
Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position in a listint_t list. It returns the address of the new node or NULL if it fails.

Task 10: Delete at index
Write a function that deletes the node at a given index in a listint_t list. It returns 1 if it succeeds, -1 if it fails.

Task 11: Reverse list (Advanced)
Write a function that reverses a listint_t linked list without using more than one loop, malloc, free, or arrays. It returns a pointer to the first node of the reversed list.

Task 12: Print (Safe Version) (Advanced)
Write a function that prints a listint_t linked list. It goes through the list only once and, if it fails, exits the program with status 98.
