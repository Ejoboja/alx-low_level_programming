Conclusion
This project delves into the world of error handling and exceptions in Python. Through a series of tasks, various scenarios involving error-prone situations are tackled, emphasizing the importance of proper exception handling techniques.

From safely printing elements of a list to handling division errors and raising specific exceptions, each task contributes to a deeper understanding of how Python deals with errors and the ways to address them effectively.

By completing these tasks, a fundamental grasp of exception handling in Python is achieved, paving the way for more robust and resilient Python programming practices.
