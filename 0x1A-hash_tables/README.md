C - Hash tables

This project delves into the world of hash tables, exploring algorithms, data structures, and their implementation in C. The primary goal is to understand hash functions, hash tables, collision handling, and their practical application.

Overview
This project aims to grasp fundamental concepts such as:

Understanding hash functions and what makes a good one
Working principles of hash tables and their usage
Dealing with collisions in hash tables
Analyzing advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
Identifying common use cases for hash tables
Data Structures
Two key data structures are provided:
hash_node_t: Node structure for a hash table
hash_table_t: Structure representing a hash table using chaining collision handling
Tasks Overview
The project involves several key tasks:

Creating a Hash Table: Implementing a function that creates a hash table.
Hash Function (djb2 algorithm): Writing a hash function based on the djb2 algorithm.
Key to Index Mapping: Generating an index for a given key.
Adding Elements: Creating a function to add elements to the hash table.
Retrieving Values: Function to retrieve a value associated with a key.
Printing the Hash Table: Implementing a function to print the hash table.
Deleting a Hash Table: Function to delete a hash table.

Conclusion
This project explores the foundational concepts of hash tables in C, aiming to solidify understanding around hash functions, collision resolution, and practical implementation of hash tables in real-world scenarios.
